          Hi, My name is Eyaan and I love playing video games. I play all sorts of video games whether that might be board games or something like
          online games. The main games that I play are online and the one's that I have been enjoying recently are called Valorant, Overwatch 2, Escape from Tarkov, and 
          the last being Minecraft which I sometimes play. The reason I play these games ie bescause I have always enjoyed playing games from a while ago.

        <p>This is a photo of a controller from the first company that I ever played video games on. The playstation holds a special place in my heart that was the first 
          controller that I ever played on and was what got me first into video games. The playstation 2 has a lot of memories with me of playing up late night on a school day 
          coming back from middle school it was I think.

        <h2>What are Video Games?</h2>
        <p>
          What are video games some might ask? Video games are something that can be classified as "a game played by electronically manipulating images produced by a computer program on 
          a television or other display screen". Video games as most people don't know also include a lof of coding that goes into them. The main language that video games are 
          produced in are C+, this is however the main language but games are made in all sorts of languages that include Java, C#, JavaScript and more.
