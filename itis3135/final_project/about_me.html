                Some of you might be wondering who I am so I am here to give you some of my personal information. I am 20 years old and currently a junior at the 
                Universtiy of North Carolina at Charlotte. I ams studying to be a data scientist in the future. I am currently aspiring to obtain my degree
                which is a BS in computer science with a concentration in Data Science. As interested as I am in data one of my other passions was learning about
                web development as I was always interested in building websites from a young age. I am currently taking Web app and Development as a class 
                and that is where I have learned most of my skills that I currently have. This is why I think that I will be able to help develop my own students 
                skill as I know that it's like to have no prior exepreince in coding with HTML, CSS, and JS.
