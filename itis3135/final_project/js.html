        The last thing that I would like to be done is to get a basic understanding of JS. This can be done throught the
        use of one of the many videos that are linked below.

        These tutorials are a great way to build your understanding of the JavaScript language and how it can be used alongside
        the 2 other languages
      </p>

      <h3>
        Assignment
      </h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          For the first assignment head over to <a href="freecodecamp.org">FreeCodeCamp</a>. Then
          after head over to the <strong>JavaScript Algorithims and Data Structures</strong> and complete all of it.
          This should help you get an understading of how JavaScript can be paired with HTML and CSS to add functionality your website.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          For the second assignment, we are going to be working off your simple website that you designed. The next thing
          that you want to do is add functions to it. This should be pretty simple if you followed the instructions above. Make one
          of the blank pages that you worked on a page for a calculator. I'm not so worried about the design more of the functionality
          of the calculator itself, making sure all the buttons work and the + sign adds and so forth. On another of the 2 blank pages
          you are going to want to make an array that can add people from user input.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          For the third assignment you are to do the certification projects <strong>Palindrome Checker </strong>,
          <strong>Roman Numeral Converter</strong>, <strong>Caesars Cipher</strong>, <strong>Telephone Number Validator</strong>, and lastly
          <strong>Cash Register</strong>.
        </li>

      </ul>
