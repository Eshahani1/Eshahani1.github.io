                Overall I really liked the website, it has everything that the client might need that I can think of. That combined 
                with some very nice features like click me and then a bunch of reviews pop up. I think that this is a perfect picture website
                and the client would be really happy with it. The color scheme really goes well with it as well.

               I really like this website as well the navigation bar works well the website is very informational on fishing. The fucntionality of the website is also 
               very nice as you cna click a selection of images to make them bigger and scroll through all of them. The one thing that I think stils out a little bit is 
               the color scheme. I think that it doesn't fit very well along with the bottom navigation link to the designed by which once clicked the color blends in with 
               the background. I think this website could go above and beyond with a little bit more contrasted colors.
