                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">Youtube</a>
              </h3>
              <p>
              Youtube is a great website that was created so people can bring entertainment to others. Initially it had a
              small start but is now ver succesfull.
              </p>
              <ul>
              <li> Contrast - There is a difference between dark mode and light mode the first thing that you will see with 
                light mode is there is white background with balck text this combined with the youtube videos that pop up
                make a very nice contrast. If you go dark mode however the contrast is the complete opposite, overall very nice
                on the eyes.</li>
              
              <li>Repetition - The font and colors across the whole webpage are very consistent and are repeatadly seen..</li>
              
              <li>Alignment - The allignment is very well sorted out with a navigation bar for quick access on the left side
                of the page and everything else in the right part along with the text under each video being a little bit indented
                leaving space for the profile picture.
              </li>
              
              <li>Proximity - No matter what page you might go on you will always have the handy navigation bar on the left side of 
                the page therefore making it really easy on the user to navigate through everything.</li>
              
              </ul>
              </section>

                </h3>
                <p>
                  The webpage is built for a garbage company. There are multiple things that you can do on this website that includes
                  buying some trashcans and other things. There is also multiple pages that you can apply for an actual job and get
                  into the career area.
                </p>
                <ul>
                <li>
                  Contrast - In most areas the white background with the black text would be usuable but in this 
                  website where there is no type of fille in between it looks pretty bad.
                </li>
                
                <li>
                  Repetition - There are a lot of different sizes of texts so there isn't that much repetition that
                  is happening.
                </li>
                
                <li>
                  Alignment - It feels like there are too many things on the screen so the allignement isn't terrible
                  but there is too much on the screen.
                </li>
                
                <li>
                  Proximity - The navigation bar isn't terrible either it works pretty well, but I think there are some things 
                  that could make the navigation through the whole webpage better.
                </li>
                
                </ul>
