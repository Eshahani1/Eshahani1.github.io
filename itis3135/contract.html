            <p>
              I, Eyaan Shahani agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Fall 2022, ABC123, Itis 3135 with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.

              I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.

              I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.

              I also understand that given the structure and content of this class it’s possible to find many examples online or even view my classmates’ code directly. I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and will not cut and paste code except where I havei have properly given credit (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates.

              Signed: <em>Eyaan Shahani</em> , 09/12/2022
