      </h2>

      <h1>Project Overview</h1>

      <p>The main purpose of this project is going to be learning the basics of css javascript and html. THe website is going to include tons of free rescources that I think
        help the most because I know what helped me the most in contrary to what might not work the best. The intended users are going to be people that are just starting out
        their jorney and have no clue where to start. The content on the website is going to introduce you to the teacher which is me ways to contact me the hours that I will be
        available and lastly where to get started when it comes to coding.
